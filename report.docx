Outline

PCOS Lifestyle Coach is a small health-themed web application designed to support people with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in building consistent, healthy habits. The app gives users a simple dashboard where they can log daily lifestyle data (sleep, movement, mood, energy, cravings, cycle day and notes) and browse PCOS-friendly recipe ideas. Each user has a personal account, so their logs and data stay private and are only visible once logged in. Over time, the daily entries create a lifestyle diary that can help users notice patterns, for example how sleep or movement affect their mood or cravings. The recipes section includes a search feature so users can filter suggestions by ingredient or theme (for example “breakfast” or “comfort food”). The overall goal of the app is not to give medical advice, but to provide a gentle, structured tool that encourages regular self-monitoring and small positive changes for PCOS self-care.
